Allows adding customers who purchase a specific WooCommerce product to a specific Brevo list.

== Description ==

Adds a panel to the WooCommerce edit product page where you can select from your Brevo lists. When a customer completes purchase of that product, they will be added to the selected Brevo list.

This is useful for example to simplify Brevo automations. With the purchase of a given product tied to a specified Brevo list, a Brevo automation can use the [Contact added to list](https://help.brevo.com/hc/en-us/articles/15476926804370-New-automation-editor-BETA-Set-up-a-welcome-email-automation#h_01HGJTQFMDH72F17QCMG7DC8GY) trigger to start a sequence based on the product purchased.

Features include:

* Uses the [official Brevo API client](https://github.com/getbrevo/brevo-php) to interact with the API
* Simpler and more reliable at adding customer to list than the JavaScript Brevo Tracker
* Creates (or updates) a Brevo contact using the customer's email address and first/last name
* Adds [transactional attributes](https://help.brevo.com/hc/en-us/articles/10635646979218-Create-and-manage-transactional-attributes) to the Brevo contact including the order ID and price

This would be a great feature of the official [Brevo for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-sendinblue-newsletter-subscription/) plugin, but it is not currently supported. This plugin fills that gap.

This plugin is open source and contributions are welcome [on GitHub](https://github.com/AlecRust/brevwoo).

2. Set your Brevo API key at **Settings > BrevWoo**
